# PDF Generation Bug Fixes and Enhancements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. High Priority: PDF Generation Username Bug
**Problem**: The PDF generation used `req.user.username` but the User model only has `req.user.name`
**Solution**: Fixed the PDF generation to use `req.user.name` throughout the codebase

### 2. High Priority: Multiple Passenger Support in PDF
**Problem**: PDF only showed details for a single passenger, even when multiple passengers were booked
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced PDF generation to detect related bookings (same trip, booked within 5 minutes)
- Added support for group booking PDFs that show all passenger details
- Created a new group ticket endpoint `/api/bookings/group-ticket` for downloading combined tickets

### 3. High Priority: Professional PDF Design
**Problem**: The original PDF was very basic and unprofessional
**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned PDF layout with professional styling
- Added company branding with colored headers
- Structured layout with clear sections for booking details, passenger info, and payment summary
- Added important travel information and support contact details
- Responsive layout that adapts to single or group bookings

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced PDF Generation Function
- `generateProfessionalTicketPDF()` - Main function for creating professional PDFs
- `addFlightDetails()` - Specialized flight information layout
- `addTrainDetails()` - Specialized train information layout  
- `addHotelDetails()` - Specialized hotel information layout
- `addPassengerDetails()` - Comprehensive passenger information display

### 2. Group Booking Detection
- Automatic detection of related bookings based on:
  - Same booking type (flight/train/hotel)
  - Same trip details (flight number, train number, hotel + dates)
  - Booked within 5 minutes of each other
  - Same user account

### 3. Frontend Enhancements
- Updated booking display to show group booking indicators
- Added separate download buttons for individual vs group tickets
- Enhanced PDF download with proper authentication headers
- Improved error handling for PDF downloads

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env` and `.env.example` files with proper configuration
- Fixed hard-coded API URLs to use configurable base URL
- Added JWT secret and MongoDB URI configuration

## API Endpoints

### Updated Endpoints
- `GET /api/bookings/ticket/:bookingId` - Enhanced individual ticket download with group detection
- `POST /api/bookings/group-ticket` - New endpoint for explicit group ticket downloads

### Request/Response Examples

#### Individual Ticket Download
```
GET /api/bookings/ticket/60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

Response: PDF file download
```

#### Group Ticket Download
```
POST /api/bookings/group-ticket
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bookingIds": [
    "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3",
    "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b4",
    "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b5"
  ]
}

Response: PDF file download with all passengers
```

## File Changes Made
