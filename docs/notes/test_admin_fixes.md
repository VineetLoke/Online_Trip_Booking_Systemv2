# Admin Panel Fixes - Test Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Logout Button Functionality
**Problem**: Two logout buttons in admin panel (`logoutBtn` and `logoutBtn2`) were not working.

**Solution**: 
- Created dedicated `setupLogoutButtons()` function
- Properly attached event listeners with error handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Ensured admin-specific logout behavior

**Test Steps**:
1. Login to admin panel via `/frontend/pages/admin/login.html`
2. Click the "Logout" button in the sidebar (left menu)
3. Click the "Logout" option in the user dropdown (top right)
4. Both should redirect to `login.html` and clear localStorage

### 2. Loading Spinner Issues
**Problem**: Loading spinners were showing permanently instead of being replaced with data.

**Solution**:
- Added proper spinner display at start of each load function
- Ensured spinners are replaced when data loads successfully
- Added error handling with proper error messages
- Improved container validation

**Test Steps**:
1. Open admin dashboard
2. Navigate between different sections (Users, Flights, Trains, Hotels, Bookings)
3. Loading spinners should appear briefly and then be replaced with:
   - Data tables if data exists
   - "No [items] found" messages if no data
   - Error messages if API calls fail

## Technical Changes Made:

### admin.js Changes:
1. **setupLogoutButtons() function**: New function to properly handle logout button event listeners
2. **Improved load functions**: All `loadXxx()` functions now properly show/hide spinners
3. **Better error handling**: More consistent error messages and container validation
4. **Console logging**: Added debugging logs for logout operations

### Key Code Changes:
- Moved logout button setup before async operations
- Added container existence checks in all display functions  
- Standardized loading spinner HTML across all sections
- Improved error message styling and positioning

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:
✅ Both logout buttons work correctly
✅ Loading spinners show briefly and disappear
✅ Data tables display properly when loaded
✅ Error messages show appropriately when needed
✅ No permanent loading states
