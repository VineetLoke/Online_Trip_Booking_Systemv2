## System Architecture: Online Booking System

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Online Booking System, detailing the chosen technology stack and how its components will interact.

### 1. Frontend (Client-Side)

*   **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
*   **Description:** The frontend will be responsible for the user interface and user experience. It will consume data from the backend API and render it dynamically. Bootstrap will be used for responsive design and pre-built UI components, ensuring a consistent and modern look across various devices.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Displaying search forms for flights, trains, and hotels.
    *   Presenting search results in a user-friendly format.
    *   Handling user input for booking details, registration, and login.
    *   Displaying booking history and allowing cancellation.
    *   Making asynchronous requests (AJAX/Fetch API) to the backend API.
    *   Client-side form validation and basic data manipulation.

### 2. Backend (Server-Side)

*   **Technologies:** Node.js with Express.js
*   **Description:** The backend will serve as the application's core logic, handling API requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and implementing business rules. Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, will be used to build RESTful APIs.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Exposing RESTful API endpoints for all system functionalities (e.g., user authentication, search, booking, payment, cancellation).
    *   User authentication and authorization (e.g., using JWT).
    *   Processing search queries and retrieving data from the database.
    *   Managing booking logic, including availability checks and status updates.
    *   Interfacing with the MongoDB database.
    *   Handling payment processing (integrating with a payment gateway).
    *   Implementing server-side validation and error handling.

### 3. Database

*   **Technologies:** MongoDB
*   **Description:** MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that will store all application data. Its flexible schema will be beneficial for handling the varied data structures of flights, trains, and hotels, and for evolving the data model as needed.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Storing user information (hashed passwords).
    *   Persisting booking details, including flight, train, and hotel information.
    *   Storing details about available flights, trains, and hotels.
    *   Providing efficient data retrieval for search and history functionalities.

### 4. Interactions and Data Flow

*   **Frontend to Backend:** Communication will primarily occur via RESTful API calls over HTTP/HTTPS. The frontend will send JSON payloads to the backend, and the backend will respond with JSON data.
*   **Backend to Database:** The Node.js backend will use a MongoDB driver (e.g., Mongoose ODM) to interact with the database, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
*   **Backend to Payment Gateway:** The backend will integrate with a third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments securely. This interaction will typically involve API calls to the payment gateway.

### 5. Development Environment (Local)

*   **Frontend:** Standard web server (e.g., Live Server extension for VS Code, or a simple Node.js static file server).
*   **Backend:** Node.js runtime environment.
*   **Database:** Local MongoDB instance or a cloud-hosted MongoDB Atlas instance.

### 6. Deployment Considerations

*   **Frontend:** Can be deployed to any static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
*   **Backend:** Can be deployed to cloud platforms supporting Node.js applications (e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, DigitalOcean).
*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted MongoDB) is recommended for production environments.

This architecture provides a clear separation of concerns, allowing for independent development and scaling of frontend and backend components. The use of a NoSQL database like MongoDB offers flexibility, while Node.js provides a unified JavaScript environment for full-stack development.
